General TODO list for µIDL.

  - replace every non-const use of LLVMBuildSelect() with a
    build_value_select() function call, which emits a pair of basic blocks and
    a phi value when µIDL is instructed to never cause a cmov instruction to be
    emitted. Really this is the fault of bastard LLVM 2.7, which assumes cmov
    is part of the regular x86 instruction set while in the real world it's
    missing from some embedded respins of older cores (K6, winchip, etc)
