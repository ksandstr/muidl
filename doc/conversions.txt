The following CORBA IDL types are supported by ÂµIDL:

  - integer types (short, long, long long)
  - unsigned integer types (octet, unsigned short, etc)
  - floating point types (float, double, long double)
  - character types (char, wide char)
  - booleans
  - string types (string, wide string)
  - fixed-length array types
  - enumerations
  - native word types (word, fpage, time)
  - union types
  - fixed-length struct types
  - sequences of fixed-length types (except arrays)


Arrays, strings, sequences, structs and unions are made up of other types, and
are not specified as conversions but rather as encodings.

These types are mapped to L4 word types for transmission as follows:

  - unsigned integers are zero-extended to native word
  - signed integers are sign-extended to native word
  - floating point types are stored by machine-specific representation
    (bit-cast) in little-endian order (where necessary)
  - characters are handled as unsigned short
  - wide characters are handled as unsigned long
  - enumerations are handled as unsigned short
  - native words are obviously native words
  - booleans are handled as octets
