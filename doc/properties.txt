IDL properties defined by Âµidl


For interfaces:

StubPrefix(__prefix) -- forces a constant prefix for generated stubs and
disables prefix abbreviation for them (since there's presumably nothing to
abbreviate anymore). TODO

IfaceLabel(u16) -- identify the interface's operations by this u16 in the
tag's label field, and the op declaration's label in MR1. Helps conserve the
label space.


For operations:

Label(u16) -- the operation's message label. TODO

TagMask(u32/64) -- a mask applied to the raw representation of the message
tag before it is compared with Label. This permits definition of handlers for
the L4.X2 protocols. TODO

StubSendTimeout, StubRecvTimeout -- if one or both of these are defined,
a stub with timeout parameters is emitted. StubRecvTimeout cannot be specified
for a oneway operation.

StubTimeouts -- equivalent to StubSendTimeout and StubRecvTimeout at the same
time.


For operation parameters:

MR(n) -- force an in-parameter or an out-parameter into a particular message
word. Only valid for single-word fixed-length types. (TODO: When applied to
inout parameters, equivalent to InMR(n), OutMR(n).)

InMR(n), OutMR(n) -- force an in-out parameter's message words on either side
of the transfer. TODO


For enums:

NoValuePrefix -- instead of [mod_][iface_]enumname_valuename, put just
"valuename" in the enumeration field. TODO


For structs:

NoPacked -- don't emit the C structure declaration with
__attribute__((__packed__)).


For exceptions (libIDL doesn't recognize properties on exceptions yet!):

NegativeReturn(fieldname) -- pass fieldname, which must be an unsigned short
or octet type, in the return value of a stub that is declared to raise this
exception. To pop the exception, the server-side uses a negative return
code. TODO

Label(u16) -- the label by which this exception is identified by. May not
overlap the labels of other exceptions declared as raised by the same
operation. TODO
