Exceptional results from operations.

There are two kinds of exceptional results from operations that are encoded as
a reply IPC: negativereturn exceptions (with a single unsigned short, short,
or octet field) and complex exceptions. The first is encoded simply as label =
1, mr1 = errval.

Complex exceptions are encoded as label = 2, mr1 = exnhash. exnhash is
computed as per djb2 (with k=33, initial hash = 5381) from an input string
that consists of the following, each entry separated by a space:

  - for each element, the element's name, followed by a colon, followed by bit
    size, separated by space;
  - the repository ID of the exception;
  - the sum of the word sizes of the exception's elements as base-10 string
    representation without leading zeroes or sign.

Integers are represented in base-10 as ASCII strings without leading zeroes or
sign.

Thus for instance, the following exception:

exception TestFailure {
	long foo;
	octet bar;
	boolean truth;
	octet change[7];
};

Would be identified by the djb2 hash of "foo:32 bar:8 truth:1 change:56
IDL:TestFailure:1.0 4".


A complex exception is encoded as though it were a series of in-parameters,
starting at mr2. ÂµIDL will not accept an operation that raises two exceptions
with identical hashes.
